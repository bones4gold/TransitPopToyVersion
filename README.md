# TransitPopToyVersion
This is a very basic version of the survey side of my transit pop idea for buildspace. 
Users would first build a profile with whatever demographic information they would like to use, and then surveys can be focused on getting answers from specific demographics for companies/clients. I wanted to use a wide array of question formats to showcase ability. 
PLEASE DONT ENTER REAL PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION WHEN TRYING
There are no security features keeping your answers safe in the toy version.
